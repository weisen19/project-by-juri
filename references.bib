    abstract = {{Alternative equity indexes are likely to outperform traditional cap-weighted indexes over the long term, research results show that such smart beta strategies are exposed to several types of risk, including systematic risk (e.g., factor tilts), specific risk (related to the assumptions and inputs of a strategy), and relative risk (i.e., the risk of potentially severe underperformance) compared to cap-weighted indexes that can last for extended periods of time. Smart beta can play an important role in institutional investors' allocations, but only at the price of implementing a genuine risk-management process. This article discusses a new approach to smart beta investing (Smart Beta 2.0) that not only deviates from the default solution of using market capitalization as the sole criterion for weighting and constituent selection, but also analyzes and manages the risks of such deviations.}},

Darryll Hendricks, Jayendu Patel, and Richard Zeckhauser's (1993) 'hot hands' result is mostly driven by the one-year momentum effect of Narasimham Jegadeesh and Sheridan Titman (1993), but individual funds do not earn higher returns from following the momentum strategy in stocks. The only significant persistence not explained is concentrated in strong underperformance by the worst-return mutual funds. The results do not support the existence of skilled or informed mutual fund portfolio managers. Copyright 1997 by American Finance Association.},

In their paper, it was claimed that (under the assumption that there is no upper limit on the investment in an asset) the number of nonzero assets in the optimal portfolio is at most 2T + 2, where T is the number of time periods in the database used to approximate the parameters of the return distributions of the assets. The formulation we present, which is shown to be equivalent to that of Konno and Yamazaki, has a bound of T + 2 on the number of nonzero assets in the optimal portfolio.},

	takes advantage of models of covariance to simplify the equations
	that determine optimality. Fast algorithms exist for widely applied
	factor and scenario analysis for long-only portfolios. To allow their
	use in factor and scenario analysis for long-short portfolios, the
	concept of "trimability" is introduced. The conclusion is that the
	same fast algorithms that were designed for long-only portfolios
	can be used, virtually unchanged, for long-short portfolio optimization--provided
	the portfolio is trimable, which usually holds in practice.},

  edition = {2},
  publisher = {Oxford University Press},
  abstract = {In spite of theoretical benefits, Markowitz mean-variance (MV) optimized portfolios often fail to meet practical investment goals of marketability, usability, and performance, prompting many investors to seek simpler alternatives. Financial experts Richard and Robert Michaud demonstrate that the limitations of MV optimization are not the result of conceptual flaws in Markowitz theory but unrealistic representation of investment information. What is missing is a realistic treatment of estimation error in the optimization and rebalancing process. The text provides a non-technical review of classical Markowitz optimization and traditional objections. The authors demonstrate that in practice the single most important limitation of MV optimization is oversensitivity to estimation error. Portfolio optimization requires a modern statistical perspective. Efficient Asset Management, Second Edition uses Monte Carlo resampling to address information uncertainty and define Resampled Efficiency(TM) (RE) technology. RE optimized portfolios represent a new definition of portfolio optimality that is more investment intuitive, robust, and provably investment effective. RE rebalancing provides the first rigorous portfolio trading, monitoring, and asset importance rules, avoiding widespread ad hoc methods in current practice. The Second Edition resolves several open issues and misunderstandings that have emerged since the original edition. The new edition includes new proofs of effectiveness, substantial revisions of statistical estimation, extensive discussion of long-short optimization, and new tools for dealing with estimation error in applications and enhancing computational efficiency. RE optimization is shown to be a Bayesian-based generalization and enhancement of Markowitz's solution. RE technology corrects many current practices that may adversely impact the investment value of trillions of dollars under current asset management. RE optimization technology may also be useful in other financial optimizations and more generally in multivariate estimation contexts of information uncertainty with Bayesian linear constraints. Michaud and Michaud's new book includes numerous additional proposals to enhance investment value including Stein and Bayesian methods for improved input estimation, the use of portfolio priors, and an economic perspective for asset-liability optimization. Applications include investment policy, asset allocation, and equity portfolio optimization. A final chapter includes practical advice for avoiding simple portfolio design errors. A simple global asset allocation problem illustrates portfolio optimization techniques. The presentation is intuitive, rigorous and informed with institutional management experience to appeal to investment management executives, consultants, fund trustees, brokers, academics, and anyone seeking to stay abreast of the future of investment technology. With its important implications for investment practice, Efficient Asset Management's highly intuitive yet rigorous approach to defining optimal portfolios will appeal to investment management executives, consultants, brokers, and anyone seeking to stay abreast of current investment technology. Through practical examples and illustrations, Michaud and Michaud update the practice of optimization for modern investment management.},

This is the strictly positive portfolio that when used as benchmark makes all benchmarked nonnegative portfolios supermartingales, that is intuitively speaking downward trending or trendless. It can be shown to equal the Kelly portfolio which maximizes expected logarithmic utility. In several ways the Kelly or numeraire portfolio is the \&quot;best\&quot; performing portfolio and can not be out performed systematically by any other nonnegative portfolio. Its use in pricing as numeraire leads directly to the real world pricing formula, which employs the real world probability when calculating conditional expectations. In a large regular financial market, the Kelly portfolio is shown to be approximated by well diversified portfolios.},

  abstract = {Estimation theory has shown, due to the limited estimation window available for real asset data, the sample based Markowitz mean-variance approach produces unreliable weights which fluctuate substantially over time. This paper proposes an alternate approach to portfolio optimization, being the use of naive diversification to approximate the numeraire portfolio. The numeraire portfolio is the strictly positive portfolio that, when used as benchmark, makes all benchmarked nonnegative portfolios either mean decreasing or trendless. Furthermore, it maximizes expected logarithmic utility and outperforms any other strictly positive portfolio in the long run. The paper proves for a well-securitized market that the naive equal value weighted portfolio converges to the numeraire portfolio when the number of constituents tends to infinity. This result is model independent and, therefore, very robust.The systematic construction of diversified stock indices by naive diversification from real data is demonstrated. Even when taking transaction costs into account, these indices significantly outperform the corresponding market capitalization weighted indices in the long run, indicating empirically their asymptotic proximity to the numeraire portfolio. Empirical evidence is presented that the Sharpe ratios of equi-weighted indices surpass significantly those of corresponding market capitalization weighted indices. This empirical stylized fact applies also to the market portfolio of equity markets of countries, which questions the applicability of the intertemporal capital asset pricing model. Finally, in time of financial crisis, a large equi-weighted fund carrying the investments of the major pension funds and insurance companies would provide important liquidity. It would not only dampen the extremes of a crisis but would also moderate the excesses of any asset price bubble.},
