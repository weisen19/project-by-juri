We consider 375 stocks (N) in the S\&P500 index for which we dispose of 1095 observations (T) covering the period from 2012/01 to 2016/05. \\

A common study design is to split the sample into a training and an independent testing set, where the former is used to develop the model and the latter to evaluate its performance. \\
Accordingly we start in a first step by analyzing the empirical histogram of the eigenvalues of the considered stocks over the first half of the period (2012/01-2013/12) and superimpose the theoretical Marchenko-Pastur density provided by the random matrix theory framework detailed in Section \ref{sec:RMT}.

  \label{fig:density}
\end{figure}

Based on this analysis (Figure~\ref{fig:density}), we retain eigenvalues above $\lambda_{\text{max}}=2.262$ that are assumed to contain ``information'' and shrink the remaining ones that correspond to ``noise''. For the shrinkage procedure we follow \cite{Laloux1999} and replace the noisy eigenvalues with average value such that the trace of the covariance matrix remains unchanged. This results in a ``denoised'' covariance matrix that will be used to compute the {\it correction matrix}, given by the minimum-torsion methodology explained in Section~\ref{sec:min_torsion}. \\

The following R code details the minimum-torsion algorithm:
<<tidy=FALSE, tidy.opts=list(keep.blank.line=TRUE, width.cutoff=50), comment=NA, size='scriptsize'>>=
# Compute the Minimum-Torsion Matrix
minimum_torsion <- function(cov.matrix)
{ # returns a matrix T such that sum (Var(TR âˆ’ R)/Var(R))
  # is minimal where R is a random vector with cov(R)=cov.matrix
  # subject to entries of TR uncorrelated
  
  sigmas <- diag(cov.matrix)^(0.5)
  # Correlation matrix
  C2 <- diag(1/sigmas)%*%cov.matrix%*%diag(1/sigmas)      
  
  E <- eigen(C2)
  # Square root of C2
  C <- E$vectors %*% diag(E$values^(0.5)) %*% t(E$vectors)
  # Inverse of C2
  Cinv <- E$vectors %*% diag(E$values^(-0.5)) %*%         
    t(E$vectors) 
  # Requirements for break conditions
  PIold <- C                                              
  # Initialization
  D <- diag(x = 1,
            nrow = nrow(C),
            ncol = ncol(C))                               
  
  repeat {
    DC <- D %*% C
    E <- eigen(DC %*% t(DC))
    U <- E$vectors %*% diag(E$values^(-0.5)) %*% 
      t(E$vectors) %*% DC
    diagonal <- pmax(0, diag(U %*% C)) 
    D <- diag(x = diagonal)
    PI <- D %*% U
    tolerance <- max(abs(PI - PIold))
    PIold <- PI
    V <- PI %*% Cinv
            
    # Convergence check: must be decreasing 
    print(                                                  
      sum(
        diag(V %*% C2 %*% t(V) - V %*% C2 - C2 %*% V + C2)
      )
    ) 
    if (tolerance < 0.00001)
      break
  }
  
  result <- diag(sigmas)%*%V%*%diag(1/sigmas)
  return(result)
}

In a second step, we used the torsion-matrix calibrated to the training sample and apply the corrected-benchmark strategy defined in (\ref{corrected_benchmark}) on the test sample covering the period 2014/01-2016/05. 
Figure~\ref{fig:performance} compares the cumulative performance of the {\it naive strategy} (equally-weighted) to the {\it corrected-benchmark} approach. We also consider an alternative portfolio, where we impose a long-only constraint in order to deliver a fair comparison to the equally-weighted strategy. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,  height=6cm]{figure/plot_performance_test_denoise.pdf}
  \caption{Cumulative performance}
  \label{fig:performance}
\end{figure}

We can observe a similar dynamics of the three strategies, the unconstrained corrected-benchmark portfolio, where short positions are allowed, displays a better performance together with higher volatility. The constrained portfolio also slightly outperforms the naive diversification approach with comparable volatility. \\  

In order to validate the multi-period approach, where we allow to rebalance the portfolio dynamically over time, we compare in Figure~\ref{fig:outperformance} the three strategies vs their buy-and-hold equivalent.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,  height=6cm]{figure/plot_outperformance_test_denoise.pdf}
  \caption{Outperformance vs. buy-and-hold portfolio}
  \label{fig:outperformance}
\end{figure}

An astonishing pattern emerges from this figure, both the dynamic naive diversification approaches and the long-only corrected-benchmark strategy display an underperformance with regards to the buy-and-hold equivalent, whereas the corrected-benchmark strategy (constrained) moves from a cumulative outperformance of more than 6\% in mid June 2015 towards an underperformance of 2\% at the end of the testing period. 
We also note that all strategies suffered a drawdown in the second half of 2015, with a dramatic collapse in performance of the unconstrained strategy.

% These interesting features have to be explored further, in particular after having taken transaction costs into consideration. This motivates us to pursue our research in the direction of a time-modulation of various traditional strategies in order to stabilize the portfolio dynamics and deliver a consistent performance over time.
% Moreover, several other techniques have to be tested and be further developed for ``denoising'' and estimating the covariance matrix.
